## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1
- Laravel >= 9.0

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the SharpAPI Laravel Resume Parser package.

1. Install the package via `composer`:

```bash
composer require sharpapi/laravel-resume-parser
```

2. Register at [SharpAPI.com](https://sharpapi.com/) to obtain your API key.

3. Set the API key in your `.env` file:

```bash
SHARP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. **[OPTIONAL]** Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=sharpapi-resume-parser
```

---
## Key Features

- **Automated Resume Parsing with AI**: Efficiently parse and extract structured information from resumes in various formats, including PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, and RTF.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports 80+ languages for parsing results.
- **Consistent Data Format**: Ensures predictable JSON structure for parsed data.
- **Robust Polling for Results**: Polling-based API response handling with customizable intervals.
- **API Availability and Quota Check**: Check API availability and current usage quotas with `ping` and `quota` endpoints.

---

## Usage

You can inject the `ResumeParserService` class to access parsing functionalities. For best results, especially with batch processing, use Laravelâ€™s queuing system to optimize job dispatch and result polling.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Dispatch Job**: Send a resume file to the API using `parseResume`, which returns a status URL.
2. **Poll for Results**: Use `fetchResults($statusUrl)` to poll until the job completes or fails.
3. **Process Result**: After completion, retrieve the results from the `SharpApiJob` object returned.

> **Note**: Each job typically takes a few seconds to complete. Once completed successfully, the status will update to `success`, and you can process the results as JSON, array, or object format.

### Controller Example

Here is an example of how to use `ResumeParserService` within a Laravel controller:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use GuzzleHttp\Exception\GuzzleException;
use SharpAPI\ResumeParser\ResumeParserService;

class ResumeController extends Controller
{
    protected ResumeParserService $resumeParserService;

    public function __construct(ResumeParserService $resumeParserService)
    {
        $this->resumeParserService = $resumeParserService;
    }

    /**
     * @throws GuzzleException
     */
    public function parseResume()
    {
        $statusUrl = $this->resumeParserService->parseResume(
            '/path/to/resume.pdf', 
            'English'   // OPTIONAL output language, English is the default anyway 
        );
        $result = $this->resumeParserService->fetchResults($statusUrl);

        return response()->json($result->getResultJson());
    }
}
```

### Handling Guzzle Exceptions

All requests are managed by Guzzle, so it's helpful to be familiar with [Guzzle Exceptions](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/quickstart.html#exceptions).

Example:

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException;

try {
    $statusUrl = $this->resumeParserService->parseResume('/path/to/resume.pdf', 'English');
} catch (ClientException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

---

## Optonal Configuration

You can customize the configuration by setting the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
SHARP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SHARP_API_JOB_STATUS_POLLING_WAIT=180
SHARP_API_JOB_STATUS_USE_POLLING_INTERVAL=true
SHARP_API_JOB_STATUS_POLLING_INTERVAL=10
SHARP_API_BASE_URL=https://sharpapi.com/api/v1
```

---

### Available Endpoints

#### Resume Parsing

Parses a resume in multiple formats and returns structured data points.

```php
$statusUrl = $resumeParserService->parseResume('/path/to/resume.pdf', 'English');
```

#### Quota Check

Returns information about the subscription, including usage and remaining quota.

```php
$quotaInfo = $resumeParserService->quota();
```

#### API Lightweight Availability Check (Ping)

Checks the API availability and server timestamp.

```php
$pingResponse = $resumeParserService->ping();
```
